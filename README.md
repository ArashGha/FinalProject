# FinalProject
Final Project for PythonClass

The aim of this project is to analyse how the covid-19 crisis affected the popularity of delivery services. 
Therefore, Google Trends Data is processed and analysed. The main idea is that due to closed bars and restaurants, the demand for delivery services increases. 
As by far the most popular search engine, it is reasonable to assume that this increase in demand should be visible in the Google Trends Data.
Google Trends Data displays how certain search terms evolved relatively over time.
